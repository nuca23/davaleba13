        <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be<br> distracted by the readable content of a page when<br> looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum<br> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of<br> letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content<br> here', making it look like readable English. Many<br> desktop publishing packages and web page editors<br> now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,<br> and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many<br> web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have<br> evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,<br> sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the<br> like).</p><br>
